## Database Check

To verify migrations worked, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check new columns
SELECT total_xp, daily_spin_last_used FROM profiles LIMIT 1;
SELECT xp, region, completion_quote FROM quests LIMIT 1;

-- Check badge count
SELECT COUNT(*) as badge_count FROM badges;
-- Should return: 11

-- Check quest count
SELECT COUNT(*) as quest_count FROM quests;
-- Should return: 40 (32 original + 8 new)

-- Check functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name = 'check_and_unlock_badges';
-- Should return: check_and_unlock_badges
```
